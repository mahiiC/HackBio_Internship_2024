**What is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning?** 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field concerned with the capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence. Machine learning is an application of AI that allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. It is a combination of many traditional disciplines including Statistics, Applied Math, and Computer Science, and enables computers to solve problems using examples of real-world data. Using Machine Learning, computers can learn how to discover patterns and make predictions from data provided to them.

Supervised learning is a subtype of ML in which ****every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values, i.e. machines learn from the “right answers”. The other subtypes include unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

**Supervised Learning in Breast Cancer research**

Supervised learning techniques extract parameters such as radius, perimeter, smoothness, and texture of the tumor, uniformity of cell shape/size, clump thickness, marginal adhesion, etc. from mammogram images along with their histopathological diagnoses from the research labs that serve as the data labels that indicate whether the tumors are benign or malignant. Gene expression data and clinical data can also be used for prediction of recurrence of breast cancer. Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand and clean the data followed by splitting it into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. The training dataset is then fed to the model that we want to train and the model is then tested on the test dataset and its accuracy is calculated.

Supervised learning is divided into 2 categories - Regression and Classification algorithms. In regression, the model predicts continuous values, whereas in classification, it predicts a predefined label or a categorical output variable. In the case of breast cancer, classification algorithms are used that predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant.

**Conclusion**

ML techniques can be used for the early detection of breast cancer signs in mammograms that cannot be easily detected by the human eye and expertise. Therefore, they play a major role in the automation of the cancer detection and prediction process in a very precise and efficient way and act as an effective aid to medical practitioners in cancer diagnosis and treatment.
