# HackBio Internship 2024 - Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

This repository contains my work and progress during the HackBio Internship 2024, focusing on bioinformatics and computational biology. The internship provides a hands-on learning experience in various aspects of bioinformatics, including data analysis, programming, and biological database utilization. I was selected as one of the 40 winners of the BioinformHer Project Scholarship 2024 for this intensive 8-week internship in Bioinformatics for completing the BioinformHER Module 1 project on Human TNF gene analysis.

## Internship Description

The HackBio Internship 2024 is a remote, project-based internship program designed to equip participants with practical skills in bioinformatics and computational biology. Participants engage in collaborative projects, learn from experienced mentors, and gain exposure to real-world bioinformatics applications. The program covers a wide range of topics, including:

* **Programming for Bioinformatics:** Python, R, and Command-line tools.
* **Biological Databases:** NCBI, Ensembl, UniProt, TCGA, ShinyGO, etc.
* **Sequence Analysis:** BLAST, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic analysis
* **Genomics and Transcriptomics:** RNASeq Data analysis and interpretation.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating meaningful visualizations of biological data (Volcano plots, Heatmaps)
* **Project Collaboration:** Working in teams on bioinformatics projects.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into different weeks/stages, each containing markdown files detailing the tasks and learnings from that week.
* **Week 0: Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning in Bioinformatics**
    * [Stage_0_Task/](https://github.com/mahiiC/HackBio_Internship_2024/blob/main/Stage_0_Task.md): Contains the task and reflection for week 0. This week focused on understanding the basic machine learning and data science concepts. 
* **Week 1: How to perform literature review**
    * [Stage_1_task/](https://github.com/mahiiC/HackBio_Internship_2024/blob/main/Stage_1_task.md): Contains the task and reflection for week 1. This week focused on literature review, setting up the development environment, learning basic command-line tools, and understanding the basic bioinformatics concepts.
* **Week 2: Python for Bioinformatics**
    * [Stage_2 Task/](https://github.com/mahiiC/HackBio_Internship_2024/tree/main/Stage_2%20Task): Contains the task results and reflection for week 2. This week was centered around learning and applying Python/R to bioinformatics tasks.
* **Week 3: RNA-Seq data analysis and Supervised learning**
    * [Stage_3 Task/](https://github.com/mahiiC/HackBio_Internship_2024/tree/main/Stage_3%20Task): Contains the task and reflection for week 3. This week was focused on working with RNA-Seq data of Colon Adenocarcinoma from TCGA followed by DIfferential Gene expression analysis and Functional enrichment analysis. We also learnt how to perform these tasks using Machine learning.
* **Week 4: Unsupervised learning**
    * [Stage_4 Task/](https://github.com/mahiiC/HackBio_Internship_2024/tree/main/Stage_4%20Task): Contains the task and reflection for week 4. This week centered around RNASeq data analysis using Unsupervised learning methods.
